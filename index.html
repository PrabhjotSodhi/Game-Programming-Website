    <h1>Game Developer</h1>
    <p>A Game Developer in a nutshell develops games,
        but the requirements change drastically depending
        on how big or small the team is. This can be broken
        down into tiers which I explain later.
        
        There are many similar careers like Game Developers.
        Most of the time people get confused by Game
        Developers and Game Programmers. Game Developer
        Is like a category, things like programmer, Game UI/UX
        Designer, Game Designer, Game Tester, Concept Artist
        all come under the category of game developer.</p>
